  abstract = {This paper gives new and elementary combinatorial topological proofs of the classification of unoriented and oriented rational knots and links. These proofs are based on the known classification of alternating knots through flyping, and the calculus of continued fractions. We characterize the class of strongly invertible rational links. Rational links are of fundamental importance in the study of DNA recombination.},
