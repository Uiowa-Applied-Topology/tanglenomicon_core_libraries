# Runners

## Brief

A runner is a human/machine interface layer. This abstracts the routines in
lower layers (libraries) for a user to interact with. This could be a CLI,
python bindings, a Mathematica wrapper, etc.

## Definitions

All runners are built as their project. This set of libraries can be included as
a git submodule (or equivalent).
