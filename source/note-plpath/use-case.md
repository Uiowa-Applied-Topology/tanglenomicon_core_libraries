# Use Case

## Functionality

### Mathematical description

##### Notation for piecewise linear path in $\R^3$

A mathematical knot is a smooth embedding of a collection of $S^1$ into $\R^3$ or $S^3$. These
smooth curves can be approximated by a collection of piecewise linear paths.

To support the encoding of tangles (as well as other similar objects) we allow for open paths.
Meaning curves with endpoints that are not equal.

### Computational Description

There are no special computational considerations for this use case.
